This is my live Home Assistant config. 
It has recently migrated to my HP Proliant server.
Proxmox is installed on bare metal,  then this (production) Home Assistant runs in a VM.
A separate VM provides my Dev. env
Various other VMs and LXCs are providing other services such as Plex server, NAS etc on this same machine

This repo is checked using Github Actions for continuous integration.
  * The config is first checked with yamllint and remarklint.
  * The config is validated against the currently installed version of Home Assistant, the latest release of Home Assistant, the latest beta release of Home Assistant and the Latest Home Assistant Dev branch.
  * ESPHome yaml is also validated against the latest version of ESPHome
